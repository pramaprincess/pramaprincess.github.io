Hello! 
My name is Nadya Pramaputri (pra-MAH-pooh-TREE), and I am a student, writer, and urban enthusiast. I am interested to explore various methods and tools that could:
(a) increase citizen participation, 
(b) improve decision making in urban planning settings, and 
(c) generate sustainable economic development.

## What I do
👨🏼‍⚕️ I'm a first-year Master of City and Regional Planning (MCRP) student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I studied Architecture for 4 years in Universitas Indonesia, and graduated in 2019. 
✍️ On this website I (will attempt to) write my school notes and cool stuff I found about urban planning, as well as sharing my favorite apps and tech. 
🎮 I learned to code aged 12, and worked as a freelance web designer/developer through my teenage years. This funded my World of Warcraft addiction.
🎮 I learned to play the piano at age 7, but unfortunately ...
🤑 At university (2012-2018), I started an event named Arch360 that would help our graduating students in deciding their next step post college. Our products help thousands of students each year, and we give out tens of thousands of pounds in bursaries for students from low-income backgrounds. These days, I advise on high-level strategy, and we've got a great team of students who run things day-to-day.
🎸 I enjoy playing the piano and guitar, and singing covers of mainstream pop + Disney songs. I sometimes post videos of this on Instagram, along with various selfies from work, to subtly show-off the fact that I'm a doctor. Please follow me if that sounds remotely appealing.
